# Ecomm POC
## Overview

This is a proof of concept (POC) for an E-commerce platform built using Next.js, Serverless AWS Lambda, and TypeScript. The project demonstrates a scalable, serverless architecture for handling e-commerce operations such as product management, user authentication, and order processing.
## Tech Stack
- NextJS 15 - React framework for server-side rendering (SSR) and API routes
- TypeScript - Statically typed JavaScript for better maintainability
- AWS Lambda - Serverless backend functions for handling API requests
- DynamoDB - NoSQL database for storing product, user, and order data
- AWS API Gateway - Routing API requests to Lambda functions
